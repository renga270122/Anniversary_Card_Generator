## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Security**: Your API key is stored only in your browser's local storage - it never goes to our servers
2. **Offline**: If you don't have an API key, all features still work offline!
3. **Persistent**: Once you save your key, it's remembered next time you visit
4. **Remove Anytime**: Clear your browser's local storage to remove the saved key

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid API key" Error
- Make sure you copied the entire key (no spaces at the beginning/end)
- Check that you're using the right API key from makersuite.google.com

### AI buttons not showing
- Refresh the page after saving your API key
- Check your browser's console (F12) for error messages

### Rate limiting (generating too many messages)
- Wait a minute - you're using too many AI requests
- Free tier allows 60 per minute - plenty for normal use!

## 🔒 Privacy & Safety

- ✅ We don't collect or store your API key on any server
- ✅ Your messages aren't logged by us
